The principle itself is not new, since it was already found with mechanical pianos.\nIt was created on Synthesia (a piano music creation software where the piano keys that produce sound are colored with a precise duration) on June 1, 2018 and published the same day on YouTube by Sheet Music Boss, an English creator .\nThe music has notably been taken up by players of instruments other than the piano, such as the guitar by RichaadEB or the clarinet by HD Tang.",
